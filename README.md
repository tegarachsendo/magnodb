# Magnolia Secondary Metabolites Database
Welcome to the Magnolia Secondary Metabolites Database â€” a curated collection of secondary metabolites found in the genus Magnolia, hosted and maintained on this GitHub repository.

## About the Project
This project aims to build a repository of secondary metabolites isolated from Magnolia species. The database is manually curated from scientific literature and includes structural information (SMILES format) 

## Update Schedule
The database will be updated in several batches, each focusing on a specific class of compounds.

### First Release: Alkaloids
The initial batch focuses on alkaloids, a major class of bioactive compounds in Magnolia.

## Citation & Use
Feel free to use the data for academic or research purposes. If you use this database in your work, please contact me directly for citation details.

## Contribution & Contact
This project is currently maintained by me. Contributions, corrections, or literature suggestions are very welcome
